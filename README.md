# macai
macai (macOS AI) is a simple yet powerful native macOS client made with the help of ChatGPT to interact with modern AI tools (currently, only ChatGPT is supported). You can download signed binary or support project on [Gumroad](https://renset.gumroad.com/l/macai).

> Please note that macai can currently work only with your API token for ChatGPT. See how you can get your own token here. I consider implementing demo mode so that any interested user can try powerful ChatGPT capabilities even without using tokens.

## Features
- Organized with chats, where each chat has its own context
- Backup and restore your chats
- Select one of the supported models (including GPT-4)
- Formatted code blocks
- Formatted tables, copy as JSON
- With tabs, one can easily work with multiple chats simultaneously

## Project status
Currently, macai is on very early development stage, the code has bad structure and not documented. Also, this is my very first Swift project.
